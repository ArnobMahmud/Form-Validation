# Form-Validation

**An HTML form contains various input fields such as text box, checkbox, radio buttons, submit button, and checklist, etc. These input fields need to be validated, which ensures that the user has entered information in all the required fields and also validates that the information provided by the user is valid and correct.
There is no guarantee that the information provided by the user is always correct. PHP validates the data at the server-side, which is submitted by HTML form. You need to validate a few things:
Empty String
Validate String
Validate Numbers
Validate Email
Validate URL
Input length**
